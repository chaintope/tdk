//! This crate is used for updating structures of [`tdk_chain`] with data from an Electrum server.
//!
//! The two primary methods are [`BdkElectrumClient::sync`] and [`BdkElectrumClient::full_scan`]. In most cases
//! [`BdkElectrumClient::sync`] is used to sync the transaction histories of scripts that the application
//! cares about, for example the scripts for all the receive addresses of a Wallet's keychain that it
//! has shown a user. [`BdkElectrumClient::full_scan`] is meant to be used when importing or restoring a
//! keychain where the range of possibly used scripts is not known. In this case it is necessary to
//! scan all keychain scripts until a number (the "stop gap") of unused scripts is discovered. For a
//! sync or full scan the user receives relevant blockchain data and output updates for
//! [`tdk_chain`].
//!
//! Refer to [`example_electrum`] for a complete example.
